# Geophysics-Hachathon-2017
DCGAN for seismic image generation

This is a weekend project for 2017 Geophysics Hackathon. The idea is to learn the intrinsic patterns of a seismic image using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The DCGAN structure and code were adapted from [this link](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow)
